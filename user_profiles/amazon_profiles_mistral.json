The \"Lord of the Rings\" movies were mostly successful in this regard, with the exception of the Palantir scene in Minas Tirith."

However, I can't stand excessive violence or scenes that could have been edited out to improve the overall flow of the story. For instance, in one movie I watched recently, the scenes of an Irish spy in London working for the Germans were interesting but could have been shortened or even removed altogether. Another movie featured a bald doctor in the hospital and child soldiers that detracted from the story and could have been eliminated. Overall, I appreciate a good script and solid acting, but prefer a more streamlined and less violent cinematic experience."
